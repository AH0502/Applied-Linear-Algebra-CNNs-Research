\section*{Introduction}
This research project aims to explore the linear algebraic 
foundations of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs are foundational 
to modern machine learning applications such as image and video processing,
object detection, and medical imagining, to name a few.

\section*{Background}


\section*{Research Questions}
This study seeks to answer the following questions: 

\section*{Methodology and Outcomes}
This project will include a unique blend of 
both theoretical and practical approaches for examining 
these optimization algorithms. 


\section*{Timeline}
The timeline for this undergraduate research project 
is expected to go as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{September - October:} Gather all sources. Research linear algebraic
    foundations of CNNs. 
\end{enumerate}

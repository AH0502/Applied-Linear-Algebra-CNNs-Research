# Applied-Linear-Algebra-CNNs-Research

## Overview
This repository serves as a home for my 2025 undergraduate mathematics research project. This project consists of a full-stack application and a paper. The application (within Code/) is comprised of Client/ and Server/ directories. 

## Goal
As an undergraduate project, my goal has been to explore the mathematics (Linear Algebra, Calculus, and Probability theory) behind deep learning. My paper (in Research/) provides proofs of many algebraic properties of operations (e.g. Convolution) that forms the basis of deep learning. 

### Client
- React (TS)
- React Router
- MUI Components

### Server
- Python 
- FastAPI
- Keras (Tensorflow)
- Numpy
- SOON: Manim
